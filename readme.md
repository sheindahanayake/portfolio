# Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is my personal **Portfolio Website**, built using **HTML** and **CSS** to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The website is deployed using **Netlify** for fast and reliable hosting.

## Features

- **Clean and Modern Layout**: A minimalistic design that highlights the content without distractions.
- **Project Showcase**: Displays some of the key projects I have worked on, with links and brief descriptions.
- **Contact Form**: Includes a form for visitors to reach out to me directly (this feature can be integrated with services like **Formspree** for real submissions).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout (including Flexbox and Grid for responsive design).
